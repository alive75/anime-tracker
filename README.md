# Anime Tracker - Monorepo

This project is a full-stack Anime Tracker application built with React (Vite) on the frontend and NestJS on the backend, containerized with Docker for both development and production.

This guide focuses on the recommended production-like setup using Docker Compose.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started with Docker (Recommended)

This is the simplest way to get the entire stack (frontend, backend, database) running locally. It mirrors a production environment and is ideal for deployment on platforms like Coolify.

### 1. Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine.

### 2. Configure Environment Variables
The application uses a `.env` file for configuration. Create this file in the root of the project by copying the example:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
